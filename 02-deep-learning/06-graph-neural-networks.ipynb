    "## Why graphs? — Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world data are naturally represented as graphs: social networks, molecules, knowledge graphs, citation networks, recommender systems, and more. Traditional ML models (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) assume fixed-size vectors, grids, or sequences; they don't directly model relationships between entities. GNNs operate **directly on graph-structured data** and propagate information along edges, letting each node aggregate information from its neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases**\n",
    "- Node classification (e.g., predict paper topic in a citation graph) — *this notebook's task*\n",
    "- Graph classification (e.g., molecule property prediction)\n",
    "- Link prediction (e.g., recommend new friendships)\n",
    "- Graph-level regression (e.g., molecular energy)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on **node classification** on the Cora citation graph: nodes = papers, edges = citations, features = bag-of-words of paper abstracts, labels = topic class.\n"

    "## The Core Idea of GNNs: Message Passing\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental mechanism behind GNNs is **message passing** (or neighborhood aggregation). A GNN layer updates each node's representation by performing two key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Aggregate:** Each node collects feature vectors (or \"messages\") from its immediate neighbors. Common aggregation functions include taking the sum, mean, or max of the neighbor features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Update:** Each node updates its own feature vector by combining its current vector with the aggregated message from its neighbors. This combination is typically done using a small neural network (e.g., a linear layer followed by an activation function).\n",
    "\n",
    "By stacking multiple GNN layers, a node can gather information from nodes that are further and further away. A 2-layer GNN allows a node to receive information from its 2-hop neighborhood (its friends, and its friends' friends)."
