The \"Query, Key, Value\" Analogy\n","\n","How does \"self-attention\" work? How does a sequence \"attend to itself\"?\n","\n","The \"Query, Key, Value\" (QKV) model is the key. Think of it like a search engine or a database retrieval.\n","\n","Imagine you are at a library.\n","* **Query (Q):** This is your **question**. For a word, the Query is its \"request for information.\" For example, the word \"it\" might have a Query like, \"I'm a pronoun... what noun do I refer to?\"\n","* **Key (K):** This is the **label on a book's spine**. Every word in the sequence has a \"Key\" that describes what it is. The word \"car\" might have a Key like, \"I am a singular, non-human noun.\"\n","* **Value (V):** This is the **actual content of the book**. Every word also has a \"Value\" representing its actual meaning or content.\n","\n","**The Self-Attention Process:**\n","1.  **Compare:** For a single word (let's call it \"Word 1\"), its **Query (Q1)** is compared against *every other word's* **Key (K1, K2, K3...)**. This comparison (a dot product) generates a \"similarity score\" or \"attention score.\"\n","2.  **Get Weights:** These scores are passed through a **softmax** function. This turns the scores into a probability distribution (weights that sum to 1). This is the \"attention\" – a set of weights showing how much \"Word 1\" should care about all the other words.\n","3.  **Get Output:** The final output for \"Word 1\" is a **weighted sum** of all the **Values (V1, V2, V3...)** in the sequence, based on the weights calculated in step 2.\n","\n","\n","\n","In essence, the output for each word is a new vector, \"blended\" from all other words in the sequence, based on *how relevant* they are (Q-K similarity)."],"metadata":{"id":"7cbzZmU_cnoW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3.

This efficiently calculates the \"similarity score\" between every query and every key.\n","    * If `Q` is `[seq_len_q, d_k]` and `K` is `[seq_len_k, d_k]`, then `K^T` is `[d_k, seq_len_k]`.\n","    * The result `QK^T` is a matrix of shape `[seq_len_q, seq_len_k]` containing all the scores.\n","\n","2.  **$\\frac{...}{\\sqrt{d_k}}$**: This is the \"Scaled\" part.\n","    * `d_k` is the dimension of the Key vectors.\n","    * **Why scale?** For large values of `d_k`, the dot products $QK^T$ can become very large. This pushes the softmax function into regions with tiny gradients (it gets \"saturated\").\n","    * By dividing by the square root of `d_k`, we \"tame\" these values, keeping the gradients healthy and making training more stable.\n","\n","3.  **$\\text{softmax}(...)$**: This is the \"Get Weights\" step. We apply softmax along the \"keys\" dimension. This converts the raw scores into a probability distribution (weights) for each query.\n","\n","4.  **$...V$**: This is the \"Get Output\" step.
