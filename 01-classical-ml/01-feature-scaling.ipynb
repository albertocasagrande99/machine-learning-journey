    "\n",
    "**Feature scaling** is a data preprocessing technique used to **resize the numerical values of features** to a similar range or to give them common statistical properties. This is done before training a machine learning model to ensure that all features contribute equally to the result."

    "### ✅ Why is Feature Scaling Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Distance-Based Algorithms**: Many algorithms like k-NN, k-Means, and SVMs rely on distance calculations (e.g., Euclidean distance). If one feature has a much larger range than others, it will dominate the distance calculation, making the model biased towards that feature.\n",
    "2.  **Gradient Descent Convergence**: Algorithms that use gradient descent (like neural networks and logistic regression) converge much faster when features are on a similar scale. This is because the optimization landscape becomes more uniform, preventing skewed and slow gradient updates.\n",
    "3.  **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization apply penalties to model weights. If features have different scales, their corresponding weights will be updated unevenly, making the regularization less effective."
